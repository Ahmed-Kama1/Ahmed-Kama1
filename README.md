## Why Two Accounts?

I maintain multiple GitHub accounts for specific purposes:
- **This account**: Used for [testing and education].
- **Main account**: Hosts my primary projects and contributions.

If youâ€™re looking for my most active work or want to connect, make sure to check out my main profile.
